Inflation Rate
Inflation refers to the monetary supply "inflating" aka growing larger. 
Atoms are generated based off of the total supply of atoms.
All of the inflation gets paid to those staking.
If staked-supply is less than 67%, inflation rate gradually increases, (What is the rate of increase though?) until that target is hit. If staked-supply is  greater 67%, it gradually decreases until it falls below that rate.
Inflation (supply increase) will range between 7% and 20%. That is calculated using the total number of atoms.
